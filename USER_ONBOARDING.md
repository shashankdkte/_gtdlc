![Git Time Machine](images/git_operations.png)
*Complete change tracking and version history management*

### 🎯 **Exercise: Create Your First Commit**

A **commit** represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time - similar to saving a checkpoint with detailed documentation.

**1. 📊 Review Git Status**


After adding / editing  your  file, you'll observe:
- **Modified Files**: Files with recent changes

![Git Time Machine](images/git_status.png)

- **Current Branch**: Active branch (typically "main" or "master") 

![Git Time Machine](images/git_branch.png)
- **Staging Status**: Changes ready for commit

![Git Time Machine](images/git_status_commit.png)

- **🟢 Staged**: Changes are prepared for the next commit
- **⚪ Untracked**: New files not yet under version control

**3. 📝 Write Descriptive Commit Message**
![Commit Message Writing](images/onboarding/commit-message-guide.png)

Follow professional commit message conventions:

```
✅ Effective Examples:
- "Update README with project documentation"
- "Add user authentication module" 
- "Fix database connection error"

❌ Avoid:
- "updates"
- "changes"
- "fix stuff"
```

**4. 🚀 Execute Your First Commit**

  - 🔍 Detailed change information

### 🌿 **Branch Management for Feature Development**

When working on new features, it's best practice to create separate branches to isolate your changes. This allows you to work independently without affecting the main codebase.

#### 🎯 **Creating and Managing Feature Branches**

**1. Create a New Branch**
   ![Create Branch](images/new_branch.png)
   - Click on the "Branches" tab in your repository
   - Click "New Branch" button
   - Enter a descriptive branch name (e.g., "feature/user-authentication")
   - Click "Create Branch"

**2. Switch to Your Branch (Checkout)**
   ![Checkout Branch](images/branch_new.png)
   - Select your newly created branch from the branch dropdown
   - The repository will switch to your feature branch
   - All changes you make will be isolated to this branch

**3. Make Changes and Commit**
   - Edit files as needed for your feature
   - Commit changes to your feature branch
   - Your commits will be tracked separately from the main branch

**4. Merge Your Feature**
   <!-- ![Merge Branch](images/git_merge.png) -->
   - Once your feature is complete, switch back to the main branch
   - Click "Merge" button
   - Select your feature branch to merge
   - Review changes and confirm merge
   - Your feature changes will be integrated into the main branch

#### 🔄 **Branch Workflow Best Practices**

- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like "feature/", "bugfix/", or "hotfix/"
- **Regular Updates**: Pull changes from main branch to keep your feature branch up-to-date
- **Small, Focused Changes**: Create branches for specific features or fixes
- **Clean Merges**: Resolve any conflicts before merging to main branch

#### 🎮 **Exercise: Feature Branch Workflow**

**Practice Exercise:**
1. 🎯 **Create** a new feature branch
2. 🔄 **Checkout** to your feature branch
3. 📝 **Make** some changes and commit them
4. 🔀 **Merge** your changes back to main branch

This workflow helps maintain a clean, organized codebase while allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously.

## ⚙️ Module 9: Platform Best Practices and Common Functionalities
### *"Essential Platform Guidelines and Operational Tips"*

### 📋 **Platform Performance and Navigation Guidelines**

Understanding these common functionalities and best practices will ensure optimal platform performance and user experience.

### 🎯 **Essential Platform Operations**

#### **1. 🔄 Refresh and Response Management**

**Performance Optimization Guidelines:**
- **Response Time Awareness**: If any function is unresponsive for 35-60 seconds, use the refresh button
- **Page-Level Refresh**: Use the refresh button available on the specific page, not the browser refresh
- **Operation Timeout**: Allow sufficient time for large operations to complete
- **Progress Monitoring**: Watch for progress indicators during long-running operations

**When to Use Refresh:**
- Repository operations taking longer than expected
- File uploads or downloads that appear stalled
- Git operations that seem unresponsive
- Data loading that exceeds normal timeframes

#### **2. 🔄 Sync Functionality - Critical Platform Feature**

**Sync Operation Overview:**
- **Purpose**: Synchronizes folder structure on disk with the database
- **Importance**: Ensures data consistency between file system and database
- **Frequency**: Should be performed regularly, especially after bulk operations
- **Automatic Triggers**: Some operations automatically trigger sync processes

**When to Use Sync:**
- After uploading multiple repositories
- When file system and database appear out of sync
- Following bulk copy or delete operations
- If repository listings appear incomplete or outdated

**Sync Best Practices:**
- Allow sync operations to complete fully before starting new operations
- Monitor sync progress through the interface
- Use sync after major repository changes
- Regular sync helps maintain platform performance

#### **3. 🧭 Single Page Application (SPA) Navigation Guidelines**

**Navigation Best Practices:**
- **Tab Switching**: Wait for data to load completely when moving between tabs
- **Large Data Sets**: Allow extra time for pages with extensive data
- **Active Tab Verification**: Ensure the correct tab is active before proceeding
- **Data Loading**: Wait for loading indicators to complete

**Recommended Navigation Workflow:**
1. **Navigate to Target Tab**: Click on the desired navigation tab
2. **Wait for Data Load**: Allow the page to fully load data
3. **Verify Active State**: Confirm the correct tab is highlighted/active
4. **Proceed with Operations**: Begin your intended operations

**Avoiding Navigation Issues:**
- Don't rapidly switch between tabs while data is loading
- Wait for loading spinners or progress indicators to complete
- If data appears incorrect, navigate away and return to refresh the view
- Use browser back/forward buttons sparingly in the SPA environment

### ✨ **Platform Optimization Tips**

**🔧 Performance Enhancement:**

- **Batch Operations**: Group similar operations together for efficiency
